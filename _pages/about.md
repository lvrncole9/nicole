Hello! My name is Nicole and I am a swiftie (taylor swift fan). Through this website, I would like to share with you more facts about being a swiftie! 
Why do I like Taylor? I deeply appreciate Taylor Swift's artistry, songwriting prowess, and her ability to connect with her audience through her music. Here's some facts about us Swifties: we often engage in discussions about Taylor Swift's music, eagerly anticipate her new releases, and support her through various fan communities and social media platforms. Being a Swiftie is not just about enjoying her catchy tunes; it's about celebrating her growth as an artist, her storytelling abilities, and the impact her music has on people's lives. I hope you have learnt more about me, thank you! ✿﹒ᵔᴗᵔ﹒ʬʬ﹒⪩⪨﹒⟡

Taylor's ongoing tour is called "The Eras Tour", and it is the highest-grossing concert film in history. In its three-day debut, it made $92.8 million in ticket sales just in the United States, and another $30.7 million internationally — a total of $123.5 million!

Fan traditions: us swifties make friendship bracelets before attending the concert and brings it to trade with other swifties pre-concert. I think this is super cute and will be really fun.
Big news!! Taylor is actually going to perform in Singapore next year in 2024! There will be 6 unforgettable nights and tickets were fully sold out within 2 days.
